# Buy&Sell SuperMarket (OOP in Java)

This project was developed as part of my Computer Science degree.  
It is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** implementation of a supermarket management system, written entirely in **Java**, without using a database.  

## Features
- Management of Buyers and Sellers  
- Products and SpecialPackedProducts  
- Shopping Cart functionality (add/remove items)  
- Validation rules (cannot add to a paid cart, etc.)  
- Custom Exceptions for error handling (e.g., EmptyCartException, EmptySellerException)  
- Orders history management (stored in memory)  

## Technologies
- Java  
- IntelliJ IDEA  

## Notes
This repository contains the **OOP-only version** of the project.  
A separate repository includes the **extended version with PostgreSQL database integration (JDBC, triggers, stored procedures)**.
